### [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
Note:

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.

### [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

### [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```
Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

## [Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1->2
Output: false
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```
