## [Strings](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/)

### [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

### [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


### [ First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:
```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```

Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase English letters.


### [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

### [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:
```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```

### []()
