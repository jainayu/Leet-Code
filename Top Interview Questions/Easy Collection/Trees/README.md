### [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.

## [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:
```
    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

## [Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```
