## [Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

Example 1:
```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

Note:
- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

```
For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.
```

## [Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

Example 1:
```
Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```
Note:
- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- n is a 32-bit signed integer, within the range [−231, 231 − 1]

## [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
Note:
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
- It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
- You can return the answer in any order.
