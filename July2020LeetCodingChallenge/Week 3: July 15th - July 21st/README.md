# [Week 3: July 15th - July 21st](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/546/week-3-july-15th-july-21st/)

## [Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

Example 1:
```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

Note:
- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.

## [Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

Example 1:
```
Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```
Note:
- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- n is a 32-bit signed integer, within the range [−231, 231 − 1]

## [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
Note:
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
- It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
- You can return the answer in any order.

## [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
```
Note:
- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
