## [Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its zigzag level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```

## [Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```
Note:
- The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
- Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
