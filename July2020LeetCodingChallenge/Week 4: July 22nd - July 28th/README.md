## [Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its zigzag level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```
