## [Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/)

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
```
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```
