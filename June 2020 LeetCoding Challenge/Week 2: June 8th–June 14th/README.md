## [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 218
Output: false
```

## [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Credits:
Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```
 

Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 100
    0 <= t.length <= 10^4
    Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
