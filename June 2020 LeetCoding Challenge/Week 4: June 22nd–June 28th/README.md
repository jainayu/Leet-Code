# [Week 4: June 22ndâ€“June 28th](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/542/week-4-june-22nd-june-28th/)

## [Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

## [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

## [Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

## [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```
Note:

- You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
- You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
- Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
- There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## [Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```
