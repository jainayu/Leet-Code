## [Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

## [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

## [Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```
