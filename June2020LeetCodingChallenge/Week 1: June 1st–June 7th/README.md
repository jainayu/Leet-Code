  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

```

## [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
Note:

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.

## [Two City Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/)

There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

Note:

    1 <= costs.length <= 100
    It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
    1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000
    
## [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## [Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

    1 <= w.length <= 10000
    1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
    pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
```
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## [Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.
 

Example
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

## [Coin Change 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin. 

Example 1:
```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```

Note:

You can assume that

    0 <= amount <= 5000
    1 <= coin <= 5000
    the number of coins is less than 500
    the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
