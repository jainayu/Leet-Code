# [Week 2: June 8thâ€“June 14th](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/540/week-2-june-8th-june-14th/)

## [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 218
Output: false
```

## [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Credits:
Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 100
    0 <= t.length <= 10^4
    Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.

## [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
```
Example 4:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0
```

## [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
Follow up:

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
- First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## [Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/)

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

    insert(val): Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
    remove(val): Removes an item val from the set if present.
    getRandom: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

Example:
```
// Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();

// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);

// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);

// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);

// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);

// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);

// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.
randomSet.getRandom();
```

## [Largest Divisible Subset](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/)

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]
```

## [Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

There are n cities connected by m flights. Each flight starts from city u and arrives at v with a price w.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the destination dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with up to k stops. If there is no such route, output -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: 
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: 
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
- The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
- The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
- The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
- k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
- There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
