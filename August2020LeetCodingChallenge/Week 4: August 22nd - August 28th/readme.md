## [Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/)

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:
- An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
- A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
- ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
- length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
- 1 <= rects.length <= 100
- pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
- pick is called at most 10000 times.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
```
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## [Stream of Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/stream-of-characters/)

Implement the StreamChecker class as follows:
- StreamChecker(words): Constructor, init the data structure with the given words.
- query(letter): returns true if and only if for some k >= 1, the last k characters queried (in order from oldest to newest, including this letter just queried) spell one of the words in the given list.


Example:
``
StreamChecker streamChecker = new StreamChecker(["cd","f","kl"]); // init the dictionary.
streamChecker.query('a');          // return false
streamChecker.query('b');          // return false
streamChecker.query('c');          // return false
streamChecker.query('d');          // return true, because 'cd' is in the wordlist
streamChecker.query('e');          // return false
streamChecker.query('f');          // return true, because 'f' is in the wordlist
streamChecker.query('g');          // return false
streamChecker.query('h');          // return false
streamChecker.query('i');          // return false
streamChecker.query('j');          // return false
streamChecker.query('k');          // return false
streamChecker.query('l');          // return true, because 'kl' is in the wordlist
```
Note:
- 1 <= words.length <= 2000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 2000
- Words will only consist of lowercase English letters.
- Queries will only consist of lowercase English letters.
- The number of queries is at most 40000.

## [Sum of Left Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/)

Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.
```
Example:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
