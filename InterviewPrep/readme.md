# Interview Prep

These are some questions I have done while preparing for coding rounds or interview.

## [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## [Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/)

In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.
```

Note:

- 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 6
- 2 <= A.length == B.length <= 20000

## [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that `nums[-1]` = `nums[n]` = `-∞`.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5 
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```
Follow up: Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

## [Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:
```
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
```
Example 3:
```
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
```
Example 4:
```
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
```
Note:
- 1 <= S.length <= 200
- 1 <= T.length <= 200
- S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Follow up:
- Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?

## [Contains Duplicate II](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/)

Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```

## [Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

## [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```
